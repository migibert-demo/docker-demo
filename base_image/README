This base image aims to provide a monitorable container runtime on which you run your different images.

It contains:
- consul (local agent for performing service discovery)
- collectd (local agent for collecting metrics and acting as a statsd server allowing  your application to push business metrics)
- fluentd (local agent for collecting logs)

The following environment variables define the differents components on which your container is going to connect:
CONSUL_JOIN_IP: consul master on which local agent will connect
LOG_SERVER_NAME: log server name registered in consul (something like logging.service.consul)
METRICS_DATABASE_NAME: metrics database name registered in consul (something like metrics.service.consul)
